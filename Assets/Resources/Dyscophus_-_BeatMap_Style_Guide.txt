Style Guide for Dyscophus beat maps

Basic syntax of a note is "<direction/style> <beat number>"
<direction/style (string)> - refers to the type of note to be spawned at the bottom or right of the screen
<beat number (integer)> - refers to the 16th beat where the beat will spawn.

beat number: beat numbers are in 16th notes. (the below is assuming 4/4 time, I'm not great at music theory)
	-Every 16 beats is 4 beats / tempo clicks (whole note)
	-Every 8 beats is 2 beats / tempo clicks (half note)
	-Every 4 beats is 1 beat / tempo click (quarter note)
	-Every 2 beats is halfway between two beats/clicks (8th note)
	-Every 1 beat is a quarter of the way between two beats/clicks (16th note)
So at 104bpm, a measure (or 16 beats / 4 tempo clicks) is something like 6.93 seconds


Rules:
	1-each line must contain a single "<direction/style> <beat number>
	2-notes should be in order (0,1,2, etc)
		-order only matters within each order style
		-doesn't matter whether you put left, right, up, down etc first
	3-long notes & obstacles need to be written in pairs
		-first call notes the start of a hold / obstacle segment
		-the second call note the end of a hold / obstacle segment
	4-Don't nest single notes inside a long note
		-it won't break it, it'll just be ignored, so why waste the space?

Allowable direction / styles are:
	Basic Notes:
		left  - "single beat left note"
		right - "single beat right note"
		up    - "single beat up note"
		down  - "single beat right note"
	Hold/Long Notes (must come in pairs)
		hleft  - "multi beat left note start/stop"
		hright - "multi beat right note start/stop"
		hup    - "multi beat up note start/stop"
		hdown  - "multi beat right note start/stop"
	Other Signals: (must come in pairs)
		os - "small obstacle start/stop"
		om - "medium obstacle start/stop"
		ol - "large obstacle start/stop"
		ox - "XL obstacles start/stop"

	a measure of quarter notes
